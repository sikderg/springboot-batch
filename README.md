## Overview

The application is built using the following technologies:
- **Spring Boot:** A framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- **Spring Batch:** A framework for batch processing of data.
- **MySQL:** A relational database used for storing processed data.
- **CSV:** The application reads data from CSV files for processing.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 17 or later
- Maven
- MySQL Server
- Git

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Build the application:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Create a MySQL database and update the `application.properties` file with your database configuration.

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/your-application.jar
   ```

## Configuration

Configure the application by updating the `application.properties` file. Update the following properties:

```properties
# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://your-mysql-host:your-mysql-port/your-database
spring.datasource.username=your-username
spring.datasource.password=your-password

# CSV file path
csv.file.path=/path/to/your/csv/data.csv
```

## Usage

The application reads data from the specified CSV file, processes it using Spring Batch jobs, and writes the processed data to the configured MySQL database.

```bash
java -jar target/your-application.jar
```
